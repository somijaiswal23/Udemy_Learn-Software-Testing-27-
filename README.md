## Lecture Notes

### 2 Main types of testing:

* Black box testing is the one in which the code is unknown. The testing happens based on business knowledge.
* White box testing is the one in which the testing is done based on code.

### Bug Classification:

* Functional - Work flow failures.
* Visuals - Layout and user interface distortions or mistake.
* Content - Typos, grammatical issues and localization errors in text.
* Performace - Problamatic slowness, hanging or sluggish interface.
* Crash -  The application quits unexpectedly.

#### Functional Testing:

Its an error in functionality of the components of the site. Something that doesn't do its function or doesn't work.
For eg. Menu on a webpage have some missing data or a button leads to an empty page.  

#### Performance Testing:

Definition

Performance testing is a practice performed to determine how a system performs in terms of responsiveness and suitability under a particular work load.
is an engineering exercise targeting to measure the application responsiveness while having it under particular work load and the high volume of usage so so that you can provide feedback to the project team and guide them towards
An example for responsiveness: when you press the button on an app or an item from a website menu and it takes infinite time to load and when the website becomes laggy
Examples of suitability: how the system behaves under a certain workload.For example when you try to play a game and you create more than one character how many characters will preserve the stability of the game. And when will the game become unstable and start freezing or crashing.

#### Visual Testing:

To test the GUI (Geographical User interface) of the website. Any error that is seen on the page is called visual bug.
For example: broken image or overlapped text on a web page.

#### Content Bugs:

* Mistranslated Bugs
* Translation is missing.
* Spelling and punctuation errors.
* Non-localized words.

#### Crash Issues:

You can call an issue a crash if simply two things happen with you.

* The first one is that the app closed while you were streaming music or playing or even browsing the application. Suddenly it's closed without any reason.

* The second thing is when the app becomes responsive you know this word. It's not responding. Sometimes it appears and it means that the app is having a crash.

### Bug Severity and How to write a bug report?

#### Bug Priority Level

* How fast a bug should be fixed according to its impact on the functions or features of a successful launch of the product (a website home page or an application).

* How severe is the impact of a bug on the core functionality of the component or system.

* Critical : The defect affects the core functionality or critical data. It does not have a work around. (the enduser cannot have a solution for it or replace it with another function).

* High : a feature or function is not usable as its supposed to be. Should be fixed in the first available patch or release after launch.

* Medium : Bugs that do not affect any critical user functionality. They have workarounds. The function works but in a degraded fashion.

* Low : The defect doesn't affect functionality or data. It doesn't need a work around. It doesn't impact productivity or efficiency. It is merely an inconvenience.

#### How to write a bug report?

1) A short but informative headline that includes a short description of the issue

2) When did you first notice the bug?

3) How frequently does the bug surface?

4) Where does the bug appear? (For instance, on the main menu screen or splash screen)

5) Can the bug be reproduced over and over or only sporadically?

6) What are the exact error messages that you are receiving?

7) Is there any other relevant error information to report?

8) List the steps did you take to reproduce the bug? Be specific.

9) If you canâ€™t reproduce the bug 100% of the time, indicate how often you can reproduce it (For instance, 3 of every 10 attempts).

10) State how the bug has affected your expected results. Include any suggestions that you feel could potentially fix the bug.
